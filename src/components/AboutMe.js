                    <p>Hello. I have been working in web development since 2008. As technology has evolved, I have adapted and advanced with it.</p>

                    <p>I primarily have experience working in the front-end over the years and I enjoy bringing design concepts to
                        life through code. I entered the world of full stack development in the Fall of 2017 where I gained new experience with the back-end.
                        My goal is to always keep growing as a professional.</p>
